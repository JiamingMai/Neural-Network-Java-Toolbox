# Neural-Network-Java-Toolbox
A neural network toolbox which is implemented by Java
***********************************************************************
The "Example" class gives an example of the neural network toolbox. The main method trys to train a neural network with three layers to match the XOR operation. The network works successfully. The inputs and the corresponding correct outputs are as follows:
```java
|----------------|
| Input | Output |
|----------------|
|   00   |   0   |
|   01   |   1   |
|   10   |   1   |
|   11   |   0   |
|----------------|
 ```
